# Form-REPO
Made By Maks Stankiewicz

A Repo for the Project i am working on. The Project is about creating a microsoft office VBA application and using it to use the cmd.exe even if it is blocked, and also being able to manipulate out-of-reach files and be able to delete them. If you have a school that blocks pretty much everything on the computers then the content of this repo should be of interest to you.
